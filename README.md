# Hello, folks! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
I pursued a life-long dream to become a web developer after realizing with an HR and a graphic design background.
I have a great desire to learn new things, and the ability to do so quickly. I see myself as visual individual, a tech enthusiast and a people's person. I believe that is in big part is a result of my collective expereince and backgroinf in HR, graphic dedsign and most importantly web development.
